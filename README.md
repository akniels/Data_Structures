# Data Structures
This contac=ins all the projeects worked on in the Data Structures and Algorithms nanodegree course on Udacity. It is split into thre sections and a supplemental data science practice section

## Project 1 

Project 1 focuses on the 4 tasks for building algorithms and their respective big O notations. These tasks are explained and located in the python files labled Task1 - Task4. 

## Project 2 

Project 2 focuses on problems that require more complex pythonic solutions that are based off real world problems. Problem and explanation 1 includes algorithmic solutions to an LRU caching system utlizing an enqueue and dequeue method. Problem and explanation 2 shows the use of recursion for finding the files within a folder. Problem and explanation 3 solves the popular huffman encoding and decoding computer science problem. Problem and explanation 4 shows the construction of a heirarchy with object oriented coding. Problem and explanation 5 creates a linked list equivalent to blockhain with hashed strings for identification. Problem and explanation 6 shows union and intersection algorithms for linked lists.

## Project 3

Project 3 focuses on simple coding problems using the most efficent algorithm complete the task. Probelm and explanation 1 finds the floor square root. Problem and explanation 2 searches a rotated array to find the given number. Problem and explanation takes to arrays and turns the arrays into the two max numbers. Problem and explanation 4 sorts a list of arrays of 0 , 1, and 2 in an efficient manner. Problem and explanataion 5 takes shows an example of autocomplete with Tries. Problem and explanation 6 gets the min and max of an unsorted array. Problem and explanation 6 shows an example of an http router.
