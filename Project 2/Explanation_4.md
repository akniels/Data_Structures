The task at hand was to create an efficient algorithm to test whether a user was in a group. The way I went about doing this was to was a binary search. The users and groups were both in lists. Since these wouldnâ€™t be in a particular order, and the lists were shorter, I split the group in two and did recursive functions on the halves until the item was found. 

## Help from Resources

In the Udacity lessons there was an example of a recursive binary search which I based the logic off of but built it to the task at hand. 

## Time COmplexity

is_user_in_group = O(2n)

2n represents the sort algorithm plus the recursive calls
