 Task 0 

"""
 Big  Notation Worst Case Secenario
 

 
 
 O(2)
 there are 2 steps of reading the variables and this is constant

This is most effeicent when you read the first and last row with one line 
and directly refer to the first and last line 
"""

Task 1 
"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(1 + 2n + 2x)

2 is for the set created tele_number 

2n and 2x is for the for loops based on the length of calls and texts


I could make this more efficient by reading each 
row once instead of twice and then checking if it is in the list.


"""

Task 2 


"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(2 + 2n + 1x)

2 is for the constant variables created (list check, total_time)

2n is for the for loop based on the call data

1x on the max function pulling from the list check (tele_number)

I couldnt think of a way to make this more efficient. 
"""

Task 3 
"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

PArt A Big 0 Notation

(1 + 2x^2 + xlog(x))

1 is for the constant variable created 

2x^2 is for the for loop iterating over calls. We square this function because
we also are checking the list_banaglore item which could be just as long as 
the calls table

xLog(x) is for the sort function 

Part B Big O Notation

(2 + 1n)

2 represents the two variables created which are constant

1n represents the for loop over the calls file

I couldnt think of a way to make this more efficient

"""

Task 4 

"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(5 + 1n^3 + 1x^2 + 1y^2+ x(log(x)))



5 represents the 5 valiables created in the algorithm (3 lists, two sets)

1n^3 represents the first for loop iterating over texts. This item is cubed because
one must check if the item is not in incoming text or outgoing text and the worse case is the item 
as long as the CSV

the  1x^2 variables represent the loop iteration over calls. This item is squared because
the worst case scenario is the incoming call is just as long as the call csv

the  1y^2 variables represent the  second loop iteration over calls. This item is squared because
the worst case scenario is the master list is just as long as the call csv



xlog(x) is for the sorting function in the print statement
