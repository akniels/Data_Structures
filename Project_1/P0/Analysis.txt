 Task 0 

"""
 Big  Notation Worst Case Secenario
 

 
 
 O(2)
 there are 2 steps of reading the variables and this is constant

This is most effeicent when you read the first and last row with one line 
and directly refer to the first and last line 
"""

Task 1 
"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(2 + 4n + 4x)

2 is for the variables created (text_counter, list_check)  

4n and 4x is for the for loops based on the length of calls and chats


I could make this more efficient by reading each 
row once instead of twice and then checking if it is in the list.


"""


Task 2 


"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(3 + 2n + 2x)

3 is for the constant variables created (list check, telephone_number, and total_time)

2n is for the for loop based on the call data

2x on the for loop created in the list check

I couldnt think of a way to make this more efficient. 
"""

Task 3 
"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

PArt A Big 0 Notation

(1 + 2x + xlog(x))

1 is for the constant variable created 

2x is for the for loop iterating over calls 

xLog(x) is for the sort function 

Part B Big O Notation

(2 + 1n)

2 represents the two variables created which are constant

1n represents the for loop over the calls file

I couldnt think of a way to make this more efficient

"""


Task 4 

"""
Big O Notation Worst Case Scenario

O(5 + 1n + 1x + 1x+ x(log(x)))



5 represents the 5 valiables created in the algorithm (3 lists, two sets)

1n represents the first for loop iterating over texts

the  two 1x variables represent the two for loops iteration over calls

xlog(x) is for the sotring function in the print statement
